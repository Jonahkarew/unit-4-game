# unit-4-game// Crystal Guessing Game

--

This project is a basic guessing game using Javascript.
On each new game the goal score to reach is randomized, as is that value of each of
the crystal images, which when clicked add to the players score. The game is won
when the score is reached and the wins counter increases. If the player score exceeds
the goal score, then the losses counter goes up. The page initiates a new game whenever
either of these conditions are met, while keeping the wins/losses counters through
each new game. 

This page should be compatible with all browsers except for dinosaurs.

The project was completed using jQuery, Javascript, HTML, and a tiny bit of CSS and Bootstrap.
